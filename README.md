# How to Get Unbanned on Albion Online (2025 Guide) 🎯

Getting banned from Albion Online can feel like walking barefoot through the Black Market — painful and confusing! If you think your ban was a glitch in the matrix, this friendly guide will walk you through what to do and how to appeal so you can get back to farming silver and ruling the Outlands.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did your ban follow you faster than a pack of mobs after a newbie? Or did you get banned again right after setting up a fresh Albion account? You might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! Albion Online tracks your computer hardware, making it tricky to log in with new accounts if you’re flagged.

Using an HWID spoofer can be your secret weapon to sneak back into Alba-land if hardware bans have got you locked out.
